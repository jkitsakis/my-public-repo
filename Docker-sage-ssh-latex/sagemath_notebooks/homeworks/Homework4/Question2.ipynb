    "The given function is $ y = 10 + 6 \\sin(x) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ gives the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $, which is the instantaneous rate of sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \\cos(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's evaluate the derivative at $ x = 1 $ (1 p.m.) and $ x = 2 $ (2 p.m.):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dy}{dx} \\Big|_{x=1} = 6 \\cos(1) $\n",
    "$ \\frac{dy}{dx} \\Big|_{x=2} = 6 \\cos(2) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ \\cos(2) < \\cos(1) $, we can conclude that $ \\frac{dy}{dx} \\Big|_{x=2} < \\frac{dy}{dx} \\Big|_{x=1} $.\n",

    "Therefore, the derivative is decreasing, which means the rate of change of hamburgers sold is decreasing at 2 p.m. compared to 1 p.m.\n",
