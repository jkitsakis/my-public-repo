    "A study in the United States claims that 85 % of cancer patients drink coffee. Given that the percentage of people diagnosed with cancer is 0.5 %  and the  percentage of people who drink coffee is 65 %, what is, according to this study,  the approximate probability of having cancer provided you are a coffee drinker ?\n",
